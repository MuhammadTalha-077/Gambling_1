# Solpump-inspired Crash UI Pro (React + Tailwind + Vite)

This is a **frontend-only** professional demo with:
- Animated crash chart (canvas)
- Round state machine (Waiting → Running → Crashed)
- Countdown between rounds
- Polished UI, micro-interactions, responsive layout

## Run
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Notes
- This project uses **fake/demo data** (client-ready demo).
- Wire up your backend by replacing the state machine in `useCrashEngine`.


## Chat
- Right-side chat panel (demo) in `src/components/ChatSidebar.jsx`
